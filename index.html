      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Arizona.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because I see coding as creating and as someone that loves to write I truly appreciate the ability to create something form a blank slate. I certainly see the surge in and stability of; if such a thing exists anymore, coding as well as the monetary boost that I believe it will provide. </p>
